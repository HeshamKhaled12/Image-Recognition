Initial Training
- When I first trained the model on 10 classes of animals, I noticed overfitting after 11 epochs.
- I observed that the photos needed color augmentation to improve the model's performance.
Second Training
- I ran the training again with 70% of the data for training. Overfitting persisted.
- I found that the data was imbalanced, with some classes having many more photos than others (e.g., dogs had 4000+ photos, while cats had only 1000+).
Third Training
- To address the imbalance, I upsampled the photos for the underrepresented classes.
- After this adjustment, the training accuracy improved to 98%, and the validation and test accuracy reached 96%.
- The errors mainly came from photos that were unclear even to the human eye.
